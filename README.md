TidyDataCourseProject
=====================

## Coursera June 2014 Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This submission consists of several parts:
   (1) the big tidy data set, submitted on the assignment page
   (2) run_analysis.R, the R script that created the data,
       assuming that the zip file and/or the UCI HAR Dataset folder
       is in the current directory;
   (3) CODEBOOK.md, my lame attempt at a codebook
   (4) the SECOND tidy data set, the one with the means

I will attempt to move some of the comments in the .R script
into this file to make the R script more readable.
