TidyDataCourseProject
=====================

## Coursera June 2014 Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This submission (github repository) consists of several parts:

   (1) the big tidy data set, submitted on the assignment page

   (2) run_analysis.R, the R script that created the data,
       assuming that the zip file and/or the UCI HAR Dataset folder
       is in the current directory;

   (3) CODEBOOK.md, my lame attempt at a codebook

   (4) the SECOND tidy data set, the one with the means
       For reasons that I don't understand, we don't seem to
       submit the SECOND tidy data set on the assignment page.

My imaginative names for the datasets are 

## tidyDataFrame1.txt

and 

## tidyDataFrame2.txt

Both are tab-delimited.

I will attempt to move some of the comments from the .R script
into this file to make the R script more readable.

The CODEBOOK.md contains some description of how I derived the
columns and rows of the two tidy data sets.
